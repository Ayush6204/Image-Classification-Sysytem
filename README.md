# Image-Classification-Sysytem
Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition

This project focuses on supervised image classification of color images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It leverages modern deep learning frameworks and employs data augmentation to accurately identify images across ten predefined categories.

üìä Dataset ‚Äî CIFAR-10

The CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark in computer vision research, was used to train and evaluate the model.

Key Features:

60,000 RGB images of size 32√ó32 pixels, categorized into 10 distinct classes.

50,000 training and 10,000 testing samples.

Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The implementation covers end-to-end training pipelines using TensorFlow and PyTorch within the notebooks
 directory.
